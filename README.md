# R Code: Time Series Statistics

This code, writtin in the R programming language, is for calculating time-series statistics on a stack of remotely sensed satellite imagery. This code calculates mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, maximum, and minimum values. This code was implemented and associated with the Merchant et al. (2022) study, which used a time-seris of SAR imagery and associated time-series statistics to map Arctic hydro-ecological land cover conditions.
